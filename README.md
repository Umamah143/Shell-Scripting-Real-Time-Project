#GitHub API Integration Script for DevOps

This Bash script leverages the GitHub REST API to automate the retrieval of repository access information, specifically listing users with read (pull) access. It uses basic authentication with a personal access token and jq for JSON parsing. Ideal for DevOps teams, the script simplifies access audits, enhances visibility into repository permissions, and can be integrated into broader CI/CD or compliance workflows.
